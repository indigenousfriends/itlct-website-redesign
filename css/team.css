Styles for an individual page

- Rename this file to match the page you are working on (e.g. home.css, about.css, etc.)
- Create a new file for your page and link this file to it in the <head> of your HTML document
- Variables from global.css will work in this CSS file as well. Do not add any variables to this file.

Media Queries (overriding styles for different screen sizes)

Note: Here we are using a mobile-first approach, so we start with the smallest screen size and work our way up.
Start by writing styles for the mobile version of the design on the lines above.
Anything that needs to change for larger screens should be added to the media queries below.

Feel free to change the min/max-width values to whatever you need. Use variables.
