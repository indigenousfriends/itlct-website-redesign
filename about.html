			<h4>Our Story</h4>
			<p>
				The land has a way of teaching us if we want to know, if we want to
				learn. "If These Lands Could Talk" started as an internal conversation
				that emerged during travel across traditional Din√© (or Navajo) homelands
				in the summer of 2019. Driving through the red-pigmented and towering
				mountains and canyons, I couldn't help but to wonder what these lands
				would reveal if they had a voice. As I read through stories written by
				local indigenous people accounting lessons from the past and the impact
				that persists today - I learned that there are many gaps in education
				and what is taught in traditional education or found in textbooks. As a
				world traveler, I noticed parallels between these lands and other lands
				that I had the privilege to travel to throughout my life. Much of our
				world's history is passed down through generations, best and most
				accurately at times told through the people who inhabited the land for
				generations, and through the people who still nurture these lands today.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a sudden moment, the words just came out of my mouth, "If These Lands
				Could Talk, What Would They Say?" A question and statement all at once.
				I couldn't help but to wonder how many times have we traveled somewhere
				but are not aware of what peoples lived and cultivated the land or what
				structures they built to mold, shape, or even elevate the human
				condition as we know it today?
			</p>
			<p>
				Through these experiences, I realize how the past, present, and future
				are part of an overlapping continuum of human experience - like deep
				roots coming out of a mountain.
